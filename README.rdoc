Http(s) EXtended CONnections

== Getting Started

Install the gem.

  $ sudo gem install excon

Require with rubygems.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'excon'

The simplest way to use excon is with one-off requests:

  response = Excon.get('http://geemus.com')

Supported one off request methods are #connect, #delete, #get, #head, #options, #post, #put, and #trace. 

The returned response object has #body, #headers and #status attributes. 

Alternately you can create a connection object which is reusable across multiple requests (more performant!).

  connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com')
  response_one = connection.request(:method => 'GET')
  response_two = connection.request(:method => 'POST', :path => '/foo')
  response_three = connection.request(:method => 'DELETE', :path => '/bar')

Both one-off and persistent connections support many other options. Here are a few common examples:

  # Custom headers
  Excon.get('http://geemus.com', :headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})
  connection.request(:method => 'GET', :headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})
  
  # Changing query strings
  connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com/')
  connection.request(:method => 'GET', :query => {:foo => 'bar'})
  
  # POST body
  Excon.post('http://geemus.com', :body => 'language=ruby&class=fog')
  
  # Symbols can also be used for HTTP methods
  connection.request(:method => :get)

These options can be combined to make pretty much any request you might need.

== Streaming Responses

You can stream responses by passing a block that will receive each chunk.

  Excon.get('http://geemus.com') do |chunk, remaining_bytes, total_bytes|
    puts chunk
    puts "Remaining: #{remaining_bytes.to_f / total_bytes}%"
  end
  
Iterating over each chunk will allow you to do work on the response incrementally without buffering the entire response first. For very large responses this can lead to significant memory savings.

== Proxy Support

You can specify a proxy URL that Excon will use with both HTTP and HTTPS connections:

  connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com', :proxy => 'http://my.proxy:3128')
  connection.request(:method => 'GET')

The proxy URL must be fully specified, including scheme (e.g. "http://") and port.

Excon will also use the environment variables "http_proxy" and "https_proxy" if they are present. 

If "https_proxy" is not set, the value of "http_proxy" will be used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.

NOTE: Environment variables will take precedence over a :proxy option that has been specified in code.

== HTTPS/SSL Issues

By default excon will try to verify peer certificates when using SSL for HTTPS. Unfortunately on some operating systems the defaults will not work. This will likely manifest itself as something like "Excon::Errors::SocketError: SSL_connect returned=1 ..."

If you have the misfortune of running into this problem you have a couple options. If you have certificates but they aren't being auto-discovered, you can specify the path to your certificates:

  Excon.ssl_ca_path = '/path/to/certs'

Failing that, you can turn off peer verification (less secure):

  Excon.ssl_verify_peer = false

Either of these should allow you to work around the socket error and continue with your work.
