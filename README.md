Getting Started
---------------

Install the gem.

    $ sudo gem install excon

Require with rubygems.

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'excon'

The simplest way to use excon is with one-off requests:

    response = Excon.get('http://geemus.com')

Supported one-off request methods are #connect, #delete, #get, #head, #options, #post, #put, and #trace.

The returned response object has #body, #headers and #status attributes.

Alternately you can create a connection object which is reusable across multiple requests (more performant!).

    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com')
    response_one = connection.get
    response_two = connection.post(:path => '/foo')
    response_three = connection.delete(:path => '/bar')

Sometimes it is more convenient to specify the request type as an argument:

    response_four = connection.request(:method => :get, :path => '/more')

Both one-off and persistent connections support many other options. Here are a few common examples:

    # Custom headers
    Excon.get('http://geemus.com', :headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})
    connection.get(:headers => {'Authorization' => 'Basic 0123456789ABCDEF'})

    # Changing query strings
    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com/')
    connection.get(:query => {:foo => 'bar'})

    # POST body encoded with application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Excon.post('http://geemus.com',
      :body => 'language=ruby&class=fog',
      :headers => { "Content-Type" => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" })

    # same again, but using URI to build the body of parameters
    Excon.post('http://geemus.com',
      :body => URI.encode_www_form(:language => 'ruby', :class => 'fog'),
      :headers => { "Content-Type" => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" })

    # request accepts either symbols or strings
    connection.request(:method => :get)
    connection.request(:method => 'GET')

    # this request can be repeated safely, so retry on errors up to 3 times
    connection.request(:idempotent => true)

    # this request can be repeated safely, retry up to 6 times
    connection.request(:idempotent => true, :retry_limit => 6)

    # opt-out of nonblocking operations for performance and/or as a workaround
    connection.request(:nonblock => false)

    # opt-in to omitting port from http:80 and https:443
    connection.request(:omit_default_port => true)

    # set longer connect_timeout (default is 60 seconds)
    connection.request(:connect_timeout => 360)

    # set longer read_timeout (default is 60 seconds)
    connection.request(:read_timeout => 360)

    # set longer write_timeout (default is 60 seconds)
    connection.request(:write_timeout => 360)

    # Enable the socket option TCP_NODELAY on the underlying socket.
    #
    # This can improve response time when sending frequent short
    # requests in time-sensitive scenarios.
    #
    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com/', :tcp_nodelay => true)

These options can be combined to make pretty much any request you might need.

Excon can also expect one or more HTTP status code in response, raising an exception if the response does not meet the criteria.

If you need to accept as response one or more HTTP status codes you can declare them in an array:

    connection.request(:expects => [200, 201], :method => :get, :path => path, :query => {})

Chunked Requests
----------------

You can make `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` requests by passing a block that will deliver chunks, delivering an empty chunk to signal completion.

    file = File.open('data')

    chunker = lambda do
      # Excon.defaults[:chunk_size] defaults to 1048576, ie 1MB
      # to_s will convert the nil receieved after everything is read to the final empty chunk
      file.read(Excon.defaults[:chunk_size]).to_s
    end

    Excon.post('http://geemus.com', :request_block => chunker)

    file.close

Iterating in this way allows you to have more granular control over writes and to write things where you can not calculate the overall length up front.

Pipelining Requests
------------------

You can make use of HTTP pipelining to improve performance. Insead of the normal request/response cyle, pipelining sends a series of requests and then receives a series of responses. You can take advantage of this using the `requests` method, which takes an array of params where each is a hash like request would receive and returns an array of responses.

    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com/')
    connection.requests([{:method => :get}, {:method => :get}])

Streaming Responses
-------------------

You can stream responses by passing a block that will receive each chunk.

    streamer = lambda do |chunk, remaining_bytes, total_bytes|
      puts chunk
      puts "Remaining: #{remaining_bytes.to_f / total_bytes}%"
    end

    Excon.get('http://geemus.com', :response_block => streamer)

Iterating over each chunk will allow you to do work on the response incrementally without buffering the entire response first. For very large responses this can lead to significant memory savings.

Proxy Support
-------------

You can specify a proxy URL that Excon will use with both HTTP and HTTPS connections:

    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com', :proxy => 'http://my.proxy:3128')
    connection.request(:method => 'GET')

The proxy URL must be fully specified, including scheme (e.g. "http://") and port.

Proxy support must be set when establishing a connection object and cannot be overridden in individual requests. Because of this it is unavailable in one-off requests (Excon.get, etc.)

NOTE: Excon will use the environment variables `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` if they are present. If these variables are set they will take precedence over a :proxy option specified in code. If "https_proxy" is not set, the value of "http_proxy" will be used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.

Stubs
-----

You can stub out requests for testing purposes by enabling mock mode on a connection.

    connection = Excon.new('http://example.com', :mock => true)

Or by enabling mock mode for a request.

    connection.request(:method => :get, :path => 'example', :mock => true)

Then you can add stubs, for instance:

    # Excon.stub(request_attributes, response_attributes)
    Excon.stub({:method => :get}, {:body => 'body', :status => 200})

Omitted attributes are assumed to match, so this stub will match any get request and return an Excon::Response with a body of 'body' and status of 200.  You can add whatever stubs you might like this way and they will be checked against in the order they were added, if none of them match then excon will raise an error to let you know.

Alternatively you can pass a block instead of `response_attributes` and it will be called with the request params.  For example, you could create a stub that echoes the body given to it like this:

    # Excon.stub(request_attributes, &response_block)
    Excon.stub({:method => :put}) do |params|
      {:body => params[:body], :status => 200}
    end

In order to clear all previously defined stubs you can use:

    Excon.stubs.clear

Or to simply remove the last defined stub you can use:

    Excon.stubs.shift

For example, if using RSpec for your test suite you can clear stubs after running each example:

    config.after(:each) do
      Excon.stubs.clear
    end

You can also modify 'Excon.defaults` to set a default for all requests, so for a test suite you might do this:

    before(:all) { Excon.defaults[:mock] = true }

For additional information on stubbing, read the pull request notes [here](https://github.com/geemus/excon/issues/29)

HTTPS/SSL Issues
----------------

By default excon will try to verify peer certificates when using SSL for HTTPS. Unfortunately on some operating systems the defaults will not work. This will likely manifest itself as something like `Excon::Errors::SocketError: SSL_connect returned=1 ...`

If you have the misfortune of running into this problem you have a couple options. If you have certificates but they aren't being auto-discovered, you can specify the path to your certificates:

    Excon.defaults[:ssl_ca_path] = '/path/to/certs'

Failing that, you can turn off peer verification (less secure):

    Excon.defaults[:ssl_verify_peer] = false

Either of these should allow you to work around the socket error and continue with your work.

Instrumentation
---------------

Excon calls can be timed using the [ActiveSupport::Notifications](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html) API.

    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com',
        :instrumentor => ActiveSupport::Notifications)

Excon will then instrument each request, retry, and error.  The corresponding events are named excon.request, excon.retry, and excon.error respectively.

    ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/excon/) do |*args|
      puts "Excon did stuff!"
    end

If you prefer to label each event with something other than "excon," you may specify
an alternate name in the constructor:

    connection = Excon.new('http://geemus.com',
        :instrumentor => ActiveSupport::Notifications,
        :instrumentor_name => 'my_app')

If you don't want to add activesupport to your application, simply define a class which implements the same #instrument method like so:

    class SimpleInstrumentor
      class << self
        attr_accessor :events

        def instrument(name, params = {}, &block)
          puts "#{name} just happened."
          yield if block_given?
        end
      end
    end

The #instrument method will be called for each HTTP request, response, retry, and error.

For debugging purposes you can also use Excon::StandardInstrumentor to output all events to stderr. This can also be specified by setting the `EXCON_DEBUG` ENV var.

See [the documentation for ActiveSupport::Notifications](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html) for more detail on using the subscription interface.  See excon's instrumentation_test.rb for more examples of instrumenting excon.
